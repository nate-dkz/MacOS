# Introduction
This repository is a centralised collection of macOS commands that I have found to be useful. I have gathered these commands in one place as a reference point to refer back to whenever I need them. This allows me to quickly look up and use the commands that I need, rather than having to remember them all.

As I learn new commands, I will add them to this repository so that it can serve as a comprehensive reference point. This will allow me to easily refer back to all of the commands that I have found useful, and it will also allow me to build up a collection of commands that I can use to solve various problems or accomplish various tasks.

By continuously adding to this repository, I hope to create a valuable resource that I can use to streamline my work and increase my productivity.

Feel free to browse through and use any of the commands that you find useful. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to contact me.
